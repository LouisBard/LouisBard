I'm passionate about the intersection of art, psychology, research, and machine learning. My work often blends creative projects that push the boundaries of technology, rooted in both artistic expression and psychological insights. 
I enjoy exploring how machine learning can solve complex problems, combining rigorous research methods with artistic and psychological experimentation.
